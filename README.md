- Hello, my name is Alex Wu. I'm currently a graduate student in Santa Clara University, and my major is Computer Science and Engineering. 
- In my undergraduate period, my major was Data Science. I always using Python to did data cleaning, analyzing, visualizing. While I was a intern in Academia Sinica of Taiwan, I developed questionnaire reginized system using Python. Therefore, My most familiar langugue is Python. 
- Now, I'm focus on lower level of computers, such as operating system, computer architecture and computer network. I also like to learning online course in my spare time. I'm currently learning web development on Udemy. Though programming HTML and CSS is really fun and interesting, what my patient for is back-end development. I like to constuct the logic behind scenes. In the future, I'll learn Python Flask and Go lang.
- I'm interested in playing basketball. I was a basketball player on the team of my department. Although I'm not very good on it (always be benched in games), I still love the time playing basketball with friends. I also intereted in outdoor water activities. I love to river tracing, rafting and diving. I plan to take diving course and apply diving license in the near future. Additionally, I love to watch situation comedy. My favorite one is The Big Bang Theory. I also like Modern Family, Brooklyn 99, How I Met Your Mother, and so on. In my mind, there's one little dream to become a situation comedy actor. I may go to action classes after I settle down my life in the bay area.
